# Dk PHP

Dk Library for PHP, is one in series of Dk libraries.

>About Dk Libraries: acts as a `bridge` between a framework with the app.
>It supports us write code with one style for different frameworks or libraries,
>so we don't need take an effort to remember name or usage of classes, functions...
>inside that framework or library.


## Installation

Just clone this repo and put source code under folder `src\Tool` or `app\Tool` depends on the framework we choosen.
So our folder hierarchy will look like:

- `app\`
- --- `Tool\`
- ------ `PhpCore\`


## Usage

This library provides a lot of core features. Here is a brief :

- `Tool\PhpCore\Util\DkString.php`: manipulate string operations.

- `Tool\PhpCore\Helper\DkAlerts.php`: alert popup window to client.

- `Tool\PhpCore\Exception\DkCouldNotPerformOperation.php`: useful exception when we cannot perform an action.
