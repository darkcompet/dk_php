# Dk PHP

Dk Library for PHP, is one in series of Dk libraries.

> About Dk Libraries: acts as a `bridge` between a framework with the app. It supports us write code with one style for different frameworks or libraries, so we don't need take an effort to remember name or usage of classes, functions... inside the target framework.


## Installation

Just clone this repo and put source code under folder `src\Tool` or `app\Tool` depends on the framework we choosen. So our folder hierarchy will look like:

- `app\`
- --- `Tool\`
- ------ `Core\`


## Usage

This library provides a lot of core features. For example:

- `Core\Util\DkString.php`: manipulate string operations.

- `Core\Helper\DkAlerts.php`: alert popup window to client.

- `Core\Exception\DkCouldNotPerformOperation.php`: useful exception when we cannot perform an action.
