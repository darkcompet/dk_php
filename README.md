# Dk PHP

Dk Library for PHP, is one in series of Dk libraries. This acts as `bridge` between PHP framework with the app.
It supports us write code with one style for different frameworks, so we don't need take an effort to remember name or usage
of classes, functions... inside the target framework.

## Usage

This library provides a lot of core features. For example:

- `Core\Util\DkString.php`: manipulate string operations.

- `Core\Helper\DkAlerts.php`: alert popup window to client.

- `Core\Exception\DkCouldNotPerformOperation.php`: useful exception when we cannot perform an action.
